AI to Zuck
==========

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'AI', 'ML', 'Artificial Intelligence' etc with 'Mark Zuckerberg'. Don't ask why.

- The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.
- Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
- Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.
